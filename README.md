# MC HTML
Project MC HTML is a simple HTML Minecraft themed website.

This project was created as a hobby and has been compiled with free codes found on the Internet.
There is currently no stable version of the project, but the base (main) of the page can be downloaded and used at will (Version1.zip).
If you have problems, ideas and questions, post to the "**Issues**" page.
